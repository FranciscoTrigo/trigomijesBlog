Hello, my name is Francisco TrigoMijes and this is my website/blog.
Currently, I am looking to advance my career in the cloud field with a focus on cybersecurity or DevOps.  

I have worked as a support technician in a big healthcare organization where I acted as the on-call person for nights, supporting more than 800 on-shift employees and 2000+ devices both on-site and remote.  
I also have experience supporting the infrastructure of a nationwide financial institution, where I helped to improve some of their workflows making them more efficient.  

Some others of my interests are home labs, playing guitar, technology and video games.  

The purpose of this blog is mostly to just write about things that I like, things that I do, and things that I learn.

The blog is built with Hugo and deployed with Netlify out of [this](https://github.com/FranciscoTrigo/trigomijesBlog) GitHub repo.

If you want to contact me you can reach me at [blog at trigomijes.com](mailto://blog@trigomijes.com).
