Hello, my name is Francisco and I'm an IT professional.  
I have a few years of experience in support and consulting.
I want to learn and further my career mainly in the fields of cloud computing and cybersecurity.  

Some others of my interests are homelabs, playing guitar, technology and videogames.  

The purpose of this blog is mostly to just write about things that I like.  
The blog is built with Hugo and deployed with Netlify out of [this](https://github.com/FranciscoTrigo/trigomijesBlog) GitHub repo.


If you want to contact me you can reach me at [blog at trigomijes.com](mailto://blog@trigomijes.com).
