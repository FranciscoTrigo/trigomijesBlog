Hello, my name is Francisco TrigoMijes and this is my website/blog.
I have a few years of experience in IT support and consulting, and I am looking to advance my career into the cloud field with a focus on cybersecurity.

Some others of my interests are homelabs, playing guitar, technology and videogames.  

The purpose of this blog is mostly to just write about things that I like, thing that I do, and things that I learn.
The blog is built with Hugo and deployed with Netlify out of [this](https://github.com/FranciscoTrigo/trigomijesBlog) GitHub repo.


If you want to contact me you can reach me at [blog at trigomijes.com](mailto://blog@trigomijes.com).
