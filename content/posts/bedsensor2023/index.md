For a long time I wanted to have a presence sensor that could sell if I was laying on my bed.
But never quite found what I needed, until now. I'll show you how I managed to make an usable bed (and chair!)
sensor for cheap with easy to get parts and no soldering.

## The sensor
I wanted to sense whether or not I was lying on my bed for some automation ideas that I had on mind, but my search for ready to go solutions turned out futile (except for [super expensive devices](https://www.sleepnumber.com/)). But in my quest for the right device I found out about other people making their own bed sensor out of parts!  
Basically, all you need to do is get a sensor that can feel when something is pushing on it and outputs a true or false signal, and something to connect it to your home automation system.  
This could be done in one of many ways, for the sensor you can get something like this [car seat sensor](link), or this [mat sensor](link). And as for the device, you can use something like.

### Materials
- Mat sensor
- Aqara Zigbee door sensor
- Wire cutters
- Wire strippers
- Electrical tape (optional)
- Soldering Iron and lead (optional)
