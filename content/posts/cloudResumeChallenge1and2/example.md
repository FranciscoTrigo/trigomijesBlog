## What is the Clous Resume Challenge?

> The Cloud Resume Challenge is a hands-on project designed to help you bridge the gap from cloud certification to cloud job. It incorporates many of the skills that real cloud and DevOps engineers use in their daily work.

I decided to take the challenge and follow the steps myself, in hopes of finding a job in the near future.

## Step 1: Certification

The first step of the project is to get the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certifiation. I've had this certification for quite a bit now, so I will skip this step.

## Step 2: HTML

Step 2 consists of writting a resume in HTML. The challenge provides a good [example](https://codepen.io/emzarts/pen/OXzmym) that you can use as a starting point.
