As part of my career advancement journey, I decided to start the [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/) to increase my chances at landing a Cloud Engineer role. This is the first of a series of blog post about the process.

## What is the Clous Resume Challenge?

> The Cloud Resume Challenge is a hands-on project designed to help you bridge the gap from cloud certification to cloud job. It incorporates many of the skills that real cloud and DevOps engineers use in their daily work.

That is the official explanation on the site, created by [Forrest Brazeal](https://forrestbrazeal.com/). Basically, it is a 16-step project to gain hands-on experience that you can show to potential employers to get hired more easily.  
I decided to take the challenge and follow the steps myself, in hopes of finding a job in the near future.

## Step 1: Certification

The first step of the project is to get the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certifiation. I've had this certification for quite a bit now, so I will skip this step.

The main resource that I used was actually [AWS SKillbuilder](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn), I totally recommend it if you are studying for one of their certifications.  

## Step 2: HTML

Step 2 consists of writting a resume in HTML. The challenge provides a good [example](https://codepen.io/emzarts/pen/OXzmym) that you can use as a starting point.  
This is just a raw HTML file, so its fairly simple to write it. The hardest part is figuring out the best way to word all your work accomplishments. 
You can see mine in my [repo](https://github.com/FranciscoTrigo/cloudChallenge) for the challenge.

## Step 3: CSS

This step of the challenge makes it clear that it doesn't have to be fancy. I believe this is more just about creating a static website and deploying it with the tools that AWS provide to you.  
So at the moment of writing this, I am actually using the CSS styling that was provided by the CRC challenge. I plan to change this in the future.  
You can also find this file in the repo, linked above.

## Next steps

In the next steps and blog post I am going to actually upload this site to AWS so it can be accessed over the internet.  
I am also going to deviate a bit and do a little extra because I will be migrating this blog from Netlify to AWS Amplify and use AWS CloudFront, S3 and Route53.
