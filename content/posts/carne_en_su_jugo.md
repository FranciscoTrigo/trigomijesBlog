Carne en su jugo is a traditional dish from Guadalajara, Mexico. This is the recipe that my mom taught me, and I'm going to teach it to you.

## Ingredients {#ingredients}

Here is a list of ingredients, for the most part I've never used measurements for most of this stuff and just go by what feels good that day. I'll show you a picture so you can have an idea of what proportions I use.

-   2 lb of of beef meat
    -   Your choice of cut here. But bear in mind that we are going to chop it into small pieces.
    -   My choice is "bistek suave", which apparently is called Thin Cut Beef in the USA. Sometimes I also use ground meat if I dont have bistek suave.
-   Bacon
-   Cilantro
-   Onion
-   Tomatillo
-   Chicken broth
-   Garlic
-   Grounded black pepper
-   Jalapeno pepper (If you want it to be spicy)
-   Avocado
-   Water


## Making it {#making-it}


### Prepping the meat {#prepping-the-meat}

Start by cutting the bacon in small pieces, and then put it into a kitchen pot over low heat to start cooking it. We do not want it crispy! (unless you really want to)

Cut your meat into small thin pieces. And then add it to the pot along the bacon to cook it. Remember, you want it on low heat. We dont want to cook it completely at the moment.


### Making the sauce {#making-the-sauce}

Now we are going to make the sauce. Put the cilantro, tomatillo, garlic and onion in a blender (remember to wash them!), if you want spicy, also add the jalapeno here. Don't forget to add the chicken broth and a bit of black pepper to the mix.
I usually use [this] kind of broth, so I also add water to it. But you might not need that with the other kind.
Mix it, and we have our sauce ready!

By now the meat should be a bit coocked (it needs to still be a bit red), and all the its juices should've come out. Add the sauce and also water, and then let it cook.
How much water to add will depend on your taste, but take into consideration that this dish is supposed to be watery (look at the photos to gen an idea). You might need to add a bit more broth or salt so you don't lose too much flavor to the water.

Keep it cooking on low heat until it starts boiling. It should take around 30 minutes. We will make the dished in the meantime.
