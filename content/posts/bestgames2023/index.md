I did not play many games this year, but here is a small list of my favorite games that I played.  
Most of these games are not actually recent, but I enjoyed playing them.

## Elden Ring
Elden Ring has been a fantastic experience, I have over 150 hours of playtime and around 90% of them were spent playing on my SteamDeck.  
At first I was a little hesitant about playing this game, I hadnt played any Souls-like game before, but I knew that they are very hard and challenging. I don't particularly like games that are very hard for the sake of being hard. But I read so many good things about this game that I decided to try it, and I don't regret it.

Elden Ring is hard. I spent many, many hours in the starting area being killed by all enemies. But for the most part it does not feel unfair, and it actually feels very rewarding when you get to defeat enemies.  
My favorite part of the game is how free you actually are. You can start the game and right away run pretty much anywhere on the map, go explore the vast and beautiful environments, fight (and defeat, if you are good enough) pretty much anyone; and then come back and explore more. The game is full of secrets and little details that will keep you entertained for a long, long time.

As mentioned before, I played this game almost exclusively on my SteamDeck. The performance on the system is okay and it looks good enough that I don't feel like I need to play it on my gaming PC. For me, this cemented the SteamDeck as an actually good system that provides lots opportunities to play games when I would otherwise not play (like playing in bed for an hour before falling sleep).

I still don't finish this game, and haven't played in a while. But I'm excited for when I come back to explore the Lands Between once again.


## Mario Kart 8 Deluxe


## Stardew Valley

I've eyeing this game since it came out years ago. But I always refrained of playing because it felt like the kind of game that demands long, frequent sessions of playtime. It would have been perfect when I was younger (I used to play Animal Crossing 8 hours a day, everyday on the GCN)

This is the kind of game that I feel you need to spend a lof of time on it (and its easy to loose track of time when you play it), just like Animal Crossing. 
It wasn't until I started a co-op farm with my girlfriend and her brother that I finally gave it a chance.

## Honorable mentions
